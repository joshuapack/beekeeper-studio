# Forked for M1 ARM64 of recent tag v3.1.0
You can build your self.

```bash
# First: Install NodeJS 12+, NPM, and Yarn
# You may need to install as rosetta using something like `npm install --target_arch=x64`
# I haven't tested that as locally I am able to build without issues.

# Clone and build!
git clone git@github.com:joshuapack/beekeeper-studio.git beekeeper-studio
cd beekeeper-studio/
sh ./apps/studio/build/arm-build.sh

# Get Binary in ./apps/studio/dist/mac-arm64 folder named Beekeeper Studio.app
# You can drag it into your application folder

# You could also serve it to test the build locally
yarn install && yarn run electron:serve
```

I have released the binary now, you can install and try signing it yourself. Download and unzip on downloads folder. Then run these commands in terminal:

`sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/Beekeeper\ Studio.app`
You may need to self sign it as well: `codesign --force --deep --sign - ~/Downloads/Beekeeper\ Studio.app`

Where `~/Downloads/Beekeeper\ Studio.app` is the location of the unzipped application.

The code is not that far off from the original code, however, it looks like they do not have a machine to build for M1.
If you are having any issues, feel free to ask me!

# Beekeeper Studio

Beekeeper Studio is a cross-platform SQL editor and database manager available for Linux, Mac, and Windows. Beekeeper Studio is GPL licensed so it is free (libre) and free (gratis).

## Beekeeper Studio Features

Top feature: It's smooth üç´, fast üèé, and you'll actually enjoy using it ü•∞

- Truly cross-platform: Windows, MacOS, and Linux
- Autocomplete SQL query editor with syntax highlighting
- Tabbed interface, so you can multitask
- Sort and filter table data to find just what you need
- Sensible keyboard-shortcuts
- Save queries for later
- Query run-history, so you can find that one query you got working 3 days ago
- Default dark theme

One of our frustrations with other open-source SQL editors and database managers is that they take a 'kitchen sink' approach to features, adding so many features that the UI becomes cluttered and hard to navigate. We wanted a good looking, open source SQL workbench that's powerful, but also easy to use. We couldn't find one, so we created Beekeeper Studio!

Beekeeper Studio supports connecting to the following databases:

- SQLite
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Postgres
- CockroachDB
- SQL Server
- Amazon Redshift

## Installation

## Documentation

## License

Beekeeper Studio Community Edition (the code in this repository) is licensed under the GPLv3 license.

Beekeeper Studio Ultimate Edition contains extra features and is licensed under a [commercial end user agreement (EULA)](https://beekeeperstudio.io/legal/commercial-eula/).

Beekeeper Studio's trademarks (words marks and logos) are not open source. See our [trademark guidelines](https://beekeeperstudio.io/legal/trademark/) for more information.

## Trademark Guidelines

Trademarks can be complicated with open source projects, so we have adapted a set of standard guidelines for using our trademarks that are common to many open source projects.

If you are just using the Beekeeper Studio app, and you are not forking or distributing Beekeeper Studio code in any way, these probably don't apply to you.

### Compiling and Running Beekeeper Studio Locally

Want to write some code and improve Beekeeper Studio? Getting set-up is easy on Mac, Linux, or Windows.

```bash
# First: Install NodeJS 12 or 14, NPM, and Yarn
# ...

# 1. Fork the Beekeeper Studio Repo (click fork button at top right of this screen)
# 2. Check out your fork:
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/beekeeper-studio.git beekeeper-studio
cd beekeeper-studio/
yarn install # installs dependencies

# Now you can start the app:
yarn run electron:serve ## the app will now start
```

### Where to make changes?

This repo is now a monorepo, we have several places with code, but only really a couple of important entry points.

All app code lives in `apps/studio`, some shared code lives in `shared/src`. This is shared with other apps.

Beekeeper Studio has two entry points:
- `background.js` - this is the electron-side code that controls native things like showing windows.
- `main.js` - this is the entry point for the Vue.js app. You can follow the Vue component breadcrumbs from `App.vue` to find the screen you need.

**Generally we have two 'screens':**
- ConnectionInterface - connecting to a DB
- CoreInterface - interacting with a database

### How to submit a change?

- Push your changes to your repository and open a Pull Request from our github page (this page)
- Make sure to write some notes about what your change does! A gif is always welcome for visual changes.

## Maintainer notes (casual readers can ignore this stuff)


### Release Process

1. Up the version number in package.json
2. Replace `build/release-notes.md` with the latest release notes. Follow the format that is there.
  - run `git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline | grep 'Merge pull'` to find PRs merged
2. Commit
3. Push to master
4. Create a tag `git tag v<version>`. It must start with a 'v'
5. `git push origin <tagname>`
  - Now wait for the build/publish action to complete on Github
6. Push the new release live
  - Go to the new 'draft' release on the releases tab of github, edit the notes, publish
  - Log into snapcraft.io, drag the uploaded release into the 'stable' channel for each architecture.

This should also publish the latest docs

Post Release:
1. Copy release notes to a blog post, post on website
2. Tweet link
3. Share on LinkedIn
4. Send to mailing list on SendInBlue


## Big Thanks

Beekeeper Studio wouldn't exist without [Sqlectron-core](https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core), the core database libraries from the [Sqlectron project](https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui). Beekeeper Studio started as an experimental fork of that repository. A big thanks to @maxcnunes and the rest of the Sqlectron community.
