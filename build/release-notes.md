# Release 1.11

👋 Hello everyone. We've been pretty quiet lately, but we're ramping up for a 2.0 release in the next few months.

We thought in the meantime we'd release a bunch of accumuated bug fixes and features. Some great stuff got merged, a lot of it is really meaty.

## 🏅 Headline Features

- 🥇Table exports (beta)! Export your tables to CSV, Json, or SQL.
- 🥈 Add & Duplicate Rows! Add new rows to database tables easily!

### Other Stuff
- No more Nulls when running multiple mysql queries
- Moved to `better-sqlite3` for faster Sqlite queries.
- Some UI tidy up in the tables view (new ⚙ button)
