Team workspaces allow multiple people to work with the same set of connections and queries.

Queries and Connections in your team workspace are only available for use through the Beekeeper Studio app.


## Team Workspace Key Concepts

1. **Workspace** - An online collaborative space for `members` to work on `queries` and `connections`.
2. **Workspace Member** - Someone with access to view and edit queries & connections. The workspace owner (the person who created it) can add and remove members from the workspace.
2. **Personal Folder** - Every workspace member has a `personal` folder where new queries and connections are saved by default. Items in your personal folder are *not* shared with teammates, but they are stored in the online workspace, not on your local machine.
3. **Team Folder** - If you want to share a connection or query with teammates, move it to the team folder. Everyone in the workspace has access to this folder.

## Creating a Workspace

Workspaces must be created and managed through the [Beekeeper Studio dashboard][dashboard].

Each new workspace gets a full-featured 14 day trial with no usage limits, and no credit card required.

## Subscriptions

Team workspaces is a paid service. If you do not upgrade to a paid subscription before the end of your free trial, your workspace will deactivate.

This is very sad, so instead you'll hopefully decide that workspaces are *awesome sauce*. The owner of the workspace needs to open the [dashboard][dashboard], and click the 'subscribe' button.

### What you pay for

Subscriptions are billed on a per-seat basis. The more people you add to your workspace, the more it costs.

### When you get charged

Subscription payments are in advance. For example if you pay for 1 year of service, you are paying from the time between right now, and 1 year in the future.

When we charge you:

- When you activate a subscription you will be immediately charged for the first billing period.

- When you add more seats to a subscription you will be immediately charged a pro-rated amount for the remainder of the current billing period.

- When you remove seats from a subscription you will be issued a pro-rated bill credit for the remainder of the billing period for the (now-unused) seats.

### Cancelling a subscription

You can cancel your subscription at any time from the [dashboard][dashboard].

Your subscription will also be cancelled if we are unable to collect payment. We will notify you and try 3 additional times before automatically cancelling your subscription.

When your subscription is cancelled your workspace is deactivated, bu t your data is not deleted. Simply reactivate your subscription to keep using it.

We offer a 30 day satisfaction guarantee. If you are unhappy with the service, contact us within the first 30 days of your subscription and we will issue a full refund.

## Deleting a Workspace

The owner of the workspace can delete it from the [dashboard][dashboard]. If you delete your workspace, your subscription will be immediately cancelled and your data will be archived for 30 days, then permanently deleted with no way to recover it.
